#Introduction
---------------
VOIPSpam is a Lua addon for World of Warcraft that allows you save your VOIP information and spam to raid and/or party chat.
After using macros for years to spam my vent/mumble information to thousands of pubs I felt like developing something with a much nicer GUI.
Thus VOIPSpam was born, it saves and spams! all the necessary information your pubs will need to access your VOIP server.
