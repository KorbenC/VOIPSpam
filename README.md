#Introduction
VOIPSpam is a Lua addon for World of Warcraft that allows you save your VOIP information and spam to raid and/or party chat.
After using macros for years to spam my vent/mumble information to thousands of pubs I felt like developing something with a much nicer GUI.
Thus VOIPSpam was born, it saves and spams! all the necessary information your pubs will need to access your VOIP server. 

## Instructions

#### 1. Download
Add [VOIPSpam](https://github.com/KorbenC/VOIPSpam/archive/master.zip) to your addon folder inside your wow directory. The contents inside the folder are the only thing required.

#### 2. Extract
Extract into your addon folder inside your wow directory. The default locations are: 

**PC**
```
C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\
```
**Mac**
```
Macintosh HD/Applications/World of Warcraft/Interface/Addons/
```

#### 3. Login
Log into game. At the character select screen, there should be an "AddOns" button in the lower left corner. Click on that. If any of the mods in the list that pops up say "out of date" or some such, choose the "Load Outdated AddOns" option. 

## Commands
Below are some supported commands:

```
/voip set -- Allows you to change your VOIP Spam settings
/voip spam -- Spams your VOIP settings to your party/raid
```
